## üß≠ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to give students hands-on experience with modern full-stack development.  
The students built the frontend and backend from scratch, while I provided mentoring, guidance, and final integration between both systems.

The final product demonstrates:
- A modern Angular-based frontend for managing school equipment
- A secure ASP.NET Core backend with authentication and data persistence
- A working deployment on Azure for public access
